The University of Arkansas was not very special Saturday night at Jordan-Hare Stadium in Auburn, Ala.

The Razorbacks played toe to toe with the Tigers for much of the game on offense and defense, but the Tigers dominated on special teams with a blocked punt, 48-yard punt return to set up a TD, and a back-breaking 96-yard kickoff return touchdown by Noah Igbinoghene to defeat the Razorbacks 34-3.

Igbinoghene’s return countered Connor Limpert’s 29-yard field goal after a 68-yard Razorbacks’ drive. The return TD made the score 24-3 with 9:05 left in the third quarter.

The Razorbacks actually outgained the Tigers in the first half 150-135 in total yards, but turnovers and special teams cost the Razorbacks.

Auburn’s first TD was set up by a 48-yard punt return by Ryan Davis off of Reid Bauer’s 35-yard punt. Seven plays later, JaTarvious Whitlow’s 5-yard TD run capped the 27-yard drive with 10:36 left in the first quarter.

Three possessions later, Arkansas’ Chase Hayden fumbled, and Auburn recovered and ran the ball to Arkansas’ 4. The defense held, and Anders Carlson’s 18-yard FG put the Tigers up 10-0 with 21 seconds left in the first quarter.

Auburn’s last points of the half were set up by a punt block that gave it possession at Arkansas’ 9. On second and goal from the 4, QB Jarrett Stidham ran it in for a TD and 17-0 lead that the Tigers would take into the half.

Ty Storey started at QB for the Razorbacks and played the whole game — besides occasional appearances from Cole Kelley on short-yardage plays — going 13-of-31 passing for 141 yards and 1 interception.

The Razorbacks held Auburn's rushing attack to 91 yards on 36 carries, but Auburn scored 3 TDs on the ground.
